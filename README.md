# Survey App

This is a lightweight application that will present a user with a random 2D or 3D chart.


# Prerequisites
In order to start contributing and developing you will be required to install NodeJS and 
an vscode.

[Click here to go to the NodeJS site.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Click here to go to the VSCode Side](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You should have also made a github account which in turn will allow you to create an account with Netlify. Netlify will be our cloud hosting service that we will use to get this app on the web!

# Project Overview

This project consists of a basic express application that we will use to render HTML from the server to the browser. Now we haven't decided yet on what the `view` for this will be and we are techincally open to anything we want to use that makes sense for this project.

For lession 1 we will work on defining what we think the app should do and tackle each item 1 by 1.

We will also be using some quality of life packages like winston and nodemon. These will allow us to log anything that occures in development and reset our server when we make chages.

# Getting Started

In order to get started with this project there are few things we need to keep in mind.

1. Since we are using nodejs we need to install all and any required dependencies with `npm install` command. Since you installed nodejs `npm` comes pre-packaged so you just need to run it from the terminal.

2. Now that you have the packages installed you can run `npm run dev` to run our web server in development mode.


# Project Requirements

1. Basic subtraction/addition question
2. How fast they can answer the question

## Goal
To see whether 3D bar charts are an effective means of visualising data.


- [x] Create 2D and 3D bar charts 
- [ ] Randomly display a bar chart
- [ ] Create questions for the survey 
- [ ] Add a timer 
- [ ] Collect and store the data
- [ ] Randomly display bar charts to different participants
- [ ] T Test against the data
- [ ] Mann Whitney test against data
